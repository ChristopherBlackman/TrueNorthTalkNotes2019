# pathology

## living digital
- immersion of technology in life

## how to use AI to democratise pathology
- analogy to digital
- lots of unstructured data

## zork
- reinforced learning for text based adventure games
- machine learning comprehension ( paraphrasing)
	- example

## human ingenuity
- using tools to boost this

## flip side :

- could be feed suggestions that are not appropriate
	- could be feed by malicious users
	- must be able to adapt to this

### targets : who and what
- build safeguards for this

### algorithmic greenlinning
- greenlinning : denying certain groups

## Q: metrics
- we don't have a good metric for sarcasm

# privacy by design
- 'internet has turned into a tool that subvert freedom'
- the curses of centralisation
	- massive centralisation of personal data leads to unauthorised tracking and surveillance, turning the Internet into an opposing force
- decentralisation of data : the way forward ?
	- return control ones data
	- block chain : public records repository
- privacy != secrecy
	- freedom is you making decision based on your information
- privacy = secrecy
	- user control is critical
	- freedom of choice
	- informational self-determination
	- context is key
- privacy is essential to freedom ? 
	- innovation, creativity, and the resultant prosperity
	- privacy is the essence of freedom
	- surveillance is the antithesis of privacy : negative consequence of surveillance is the usurpation of a person limited cognitive bandwidth, away from innovation and creativity
- privacy by design
	- complement regulatory compliance after the fact?
	- most privacy breaches remain undetected - as regulators we only see the tip of the icberb
	- the majority of privacy breaches remain hidden
- two essentials
	- prevent the harms form arising : must be proactive
	- banish zero sum models
- positive sum model : the power of and
	- change the paradigm from a zero sum to a positive sum model : create a win win scenario no an either/or
	- just harder
- 7 foundation principle
	1. proactive not reactive
	2. privacy is default settings
	3. full functionally : positive sum not zero sum
	4. privacy is embedded design
	5. end to end security : full life-cycle protection
	6. visibility and transparency : keep it open
	7. respect for user privacy : keep it user centre 
- book : operationalizing privacy by design
- cost of reactive
	 - class action lawsuits, damage to ones brand, loss of consumer confidence 
- General Data Protection Regulation
	- privacy by design
	- data protection by design
	- privacy by default

	- 'surveillance is the business model of the internet'
	- the unintended consequences of data
	- IoT attacks : when not if 
	- 1.1 billion identities stolon in 2016
	- data breach statistics : data records lost or stolon
	- only 4 % of data breaches on from encryption 

# fighting human trafficking with data
- where is the thch leading us and how can we leverage tech for good 
- years and year ? watch it?
- financial institutions bring the data

# Lets fix this thing
- the recognition of the reckoning
-  the internet really needs to shut the fuuuuuuuu up
	- how we want to approach the internet
	- world wide information network where everyone hates
- human downgrading
	- addiction -> systems that make you addicted to the service
	- as we get more tech, we get more stupid? ( are we even thinking, when we have AI)
- key trends
	- AI
	- automation
	- self driving
	- endless choice 
	- privacy under assault
	- continuous partial hacking

		- gives minority groups a voice (whether it is good, or bad)
	- it will make you expose yourself
- AI : anything that can be digitise will be digitised
	- mass job disruption
	- multi careers
	- Gig economy 
	- retooling
	- it becomes smarter and we become dumber
	- but it cannot fix the problem
- robotics are not killers ( they don't have to kill us to win)
	- increasing replacement of all repetitive jobs ( mining, manufacturing)
	- specific robots - food, laundry ...
	- human creativity cannot be replicated
	- they will not be human - so should human get morel robotic
		- bionics
		- printing of body parts
		- cybernetics 
	- robotic rights ?
	- but china is winning 
		- two Internets ( Chinese vs Western)

- the never ending revolution
	- populism and nativism increases globally
	- lack of unity makes marking to many harder
	- what is a brand in the new paradigm : patagonia
	- social issues impact retail. Ask starbs. ask nike

- is it linked
	- the race to catch human attention by tech giants
- its is ugly
	- downgrading attention Span, civility ...
- 'truth is at the bottom of a bottomless well'
